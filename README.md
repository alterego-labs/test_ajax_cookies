# Test setup cookies via ajax calls

Actually the solution is described [there](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22432616/why-is-the-browser-not-setting-cookies-after-an-ajax-request-returns).

I did the small mistake all the time: set cookie without _path_. So after I set the path
all works great!

Enjoy!
